# A Nix expression for nightly Rust versions

This is useful for working with the latest Rust nightly (or the nightly from a
specific date) on [NixOS]. Notably, it uses Nix's `builtins.fetchurl` feature to
avoid the need to specify source hashes manually. This feature is banned in
[nixpkgs], so this expression has to exist outside of it.

Essentially, this expression is convenient for development but unsuitable for
official packaging.

## Usage

### Invocation

The contents of `default.nix` is a function from a set of common nix packages
to a set of functions. `default.nix` is meant to be called via the callPackage
function. The functions it produces are as follows.

#### rustc

`rustc` is a function from an optional `date` (defaults to latest), and
an optional `system` (defaults to the system nix is installed on) to
a derivation for the rust compiler. If you wish, you can provide an
optional hash argument to specify exactly what the blob that 
rust-nightly-nix downloads should hash to. If no hash is provided,
rust-nightly-nix will first download the hash from Mozilla, then
use the downloaded hash as a checksum for the actual payload.

For example, 

```nix
let funs = callPackage "/path/to/rust-nightly.nix" { };
  
    rustcNightly = funs.rustc {
      date = "2016-06-09";
      hash = "1p0xkpfk66jq0iladqfrhqk1zc1jr9n2v2lqyf7jjbrmqx2ja65i";
    };
 in whatever
```

provides a hash to add some security to the build process.

#### cargo

`cargo` has the same type as `rustc`.

#### rustcWithSysroots

`rustcWithSysroots` takes rustc as an argument, plus an optional set of
derivations to be put in scope for the build of rustc. This is particularly
useful if you want to make `rust-std` avalable to `rustc`. For example
you might invoke `rustcWithSysroots` in the following way in order to
make different instances of `rust-std` avalable during the use of
`rustc`.

```nix
  rustNightlyWithi686 = funs.rustcWithSysroots {
    rustc = rustcNightly;
    sysroots = [
      (funs.rust-std {
        # date = optional date argument
      })
      (funs.rust-std {
        # date = optional date argument
        system = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu";
      })
      (funs.rust-std {
        # date = optional date argument
        system = "i686-unknown-linux-gnu";
      })
    ];
  };
```

#### rust-std

`rust-std` has the same type as `rustc`.

#### rust

`rust` has the same type as `rustc`. It is a wrapper for `rustc`, `cargo`,
and `rustdoc`.

### Setup

Download `default.nix` file onto your system somewhere. The location of that
file is your `/path/to/rust-nightly-nix`. It doesn't have to be called
`default.nix` unless you want the path to be the directory containing it.

#### NixOS System Setup

You can install this globally by adding it as an override in the system's
configuration at `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`.

```nix
{
  nixpkgs.config.packageOverrides = pkgs: {
    rustNightly = pkgs.callPackage /path/to/rust-nightly-nix {};
  };
}
```

Alternatively you can define this repo directy within your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  rustNightlyNixRepo = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
     owner = "solson";
     repo = "rust-nightly-nix";
     rev = "9e09d579431940367c1f6de9463944eef66de1d4";
     sha256 = "03zkjnzd13142yla52aqmgbbnmws7q8kn1l5nqaly22j31f125xy";
  };

  rustPackages = pkgs.callPackage rustNightlyNixRepo { };
}
```

#### Local User Setup

You can also set this up specifically for a single user by adding it to that
user's nix configuration, located at `$HOME/.nixpkgs/config.nix`.

```nix
{
  packageOverrides = pkgs: {
    rustNightly = pkgs.callPackage /path/to/rust-nightly-nix {};
  };
}
```

### Examples

Once you're set up, you should be able to run something like:

```sh
# To use a specific date:
nix-shell -p 'rustNightly.rust { date = "2016-01-01"; }'

# To use the latest:
nix-shell -p 'rustNightly.rust {}'
```

But there are more derivations in `rustNightly` than just `rust`. Check out the
source for the full list. It's not too complicated.

You could also add any of these to your `systemPackages` or user environment
(with `nix-env`).

## Tip

I also added an alias to my `packageOverrides`:

```nix
{
  nixpkgs.config.packageOverrides = pkgs: rec {
    rustNightly = pkgs.callPackage /path/to/rust-nightly-nix {};
    rustLatest = rustNightly.rust {};
  };
}
```

So I can just run `nix-shell -p rustLatest` to work with my nightly projects.

## Compile with musl

```nix
{
  rustPackages = pkgs.callPackage rustNightlyNixRepo { };

  cargoNightly = rustPackages.cargo { date = "2016-11-09"; };
  rustcNightly = rustPackages.rustc {};

  rustNightly = rustPackages.rustcWithSysroots {
    rustc = rustcNightly;
    sysroots = [
      (rustPackages.rust-std { })
      (rustPackages.rust-std { system = "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl"; })
    ];
  };
}
```

Now you can build `cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` :)

Note: of course the `musl` package needs to be installed too ;-)
